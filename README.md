## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox



### What I learned

I learnt how to use the CSS flexbox

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```css
.card {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  background-color: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
  width: 80%;
  max-width: 400px;
  margin: 100px auto 100px;
  padding: 1rem;
  border-radius: 20px;
}
```


### Continued development

I would like to focus more on CSS flexbox and CSS grids
